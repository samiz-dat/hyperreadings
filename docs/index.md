## Introduction

How might we ensure the survival and availability of community libraries, individual collections, and other precarious archives? If these libraries, archives, and collections are unwanted by official institutions or, worse, buried beneath good intentions and bureaucracy, then what tools and platforms and queer institutions might we develop instead?

While trying to both formulate and respond to these questions, we began making Dat Library (DatDatDat?!) and HyperReadings:

**Dat Library** distributes libraries across many computers so that many people can provide disk space and bandwidth, sharing in the labour and responsibility of the archival infrastructure.

**HyperReadings** implements "reading lists," or a structured set of pointers (a list, a syllabus, a bibliography, etc.) into one or more libraries, _activating_ the archives.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is to install [Dat Library as a desktop app](http://dat-dat-dat-library.hashbase.io), but there is also a program called [datcat](http://github.com/sdockray/dat-cardcat) that can be run on the command-line or included in other NodeJS projects.

## Accidents of the Archive

The 1996 UNESCO publication, [Lost Memory - Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the Twentieth Century](http://www.stephenmclaughlin.net/ph-library/texts/UNESCO%201996%20-%20Lost%20Memory_%20Libraries%20and%20Archives%20Destroyed%20in%20the%20Twentieth%20Century.pdf), makes the fragility of historical repositories startlingly clear. "[A]cidified paper that crumbles to dust, leather, parchment, film and magnetic light attacked by light, heat humidity or dust" all assault archives. "Floods, fires, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes" and, of course, "acts of war, bombardment and fire, whether deliberate or accidental" wiped out significant portions of many hundreds of major research libraries worldwide. When expanding the scope to consider public, private, and community libraries, that number becomes uncountable.

Published during the early days of the World Wide Web, the report acknowledges the emerging role of digitization ("online databases, CD-ROM etc."), but today we might reflect on the last 20 years, which has also introduced new forms of loss.

Digital archives and libraries are subject to a number of potential hazards: technical accidents like disk failures, accidental deletions, misplaced data, imperfect migrations; and political-economic accidents like defunding of the hosting insitution, deaccessioning parts of the collection, and sudden restriction of access rights. Immediately after library.nu was shut down on the grounds of copyright infringement, [Lawrence Liang wrote](https://kafila.online/2012/02/19/library-nu-r-i-p/) of feeling "first and foremost as a visceral experience of loss." 

Whatever its legal status, the abrupt absence of a collection 400,000 books emerged as a prototype for the 21st century. In 2008, Aaron Swartz moved millions of U.S. federal court documents out from behind a paywall resulting in a trial and FBI investigation. Three years later he was arrested and indicted for a similar gesture, systematically downloading academic journal articles from JSTOR. That year, Kazakhstani scientist Alexandra Elbakyan began Sci-Hub in response to scientific journal articles that were prohibitively expensive for scholars based outside of Western academic institutions. The repository, growing to more than 60 millions papers, was sued in 2015 by Elsevier for $15 million resulting and a permanent injunction. Library Genesis, another library of comparable scale, finds itself in a similar legal predicament.

The simple fact is that some of these libraries are among the largest in the world and also subject to sudden disappearance. We can only begin to grope at what the contours of "Lost Memory - Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the Twenty-First Century" will be when it is written 90 years from now.

## Non-profit, non-state archives

Cultural and social movements have produced histories which are only partly represented in state libraries and archives. Often they are deemed too small or insignificant or, in some cases, dangerous. Most frequently, they are not deemed anything at all - they are simply neglected. While the market, eager for any new resources to exploit, might occasionally fill in the gaps, it is ultimately motivated by profit and not by responsibility to communities or archives.

So what happens to these minor libraries? They are innumerable, but for the sake of argument let's say that each could be respresented by a single book. Gathered together, these books would form a great library (in both importance and scale). But to return this image to reality, these books fly off their shelves to the furthest reaches of the world, their covers fling open and the pages themselves scatter into bookshelves and basements, into the caring hands of relatives or small institutions devoted to passing these archives on to future generations.

While the massive digital archives listed above (library.nu, Library Genesis, Sci-Hub, etc.) could play the role of the library of libraries, they tend to be defined more as sites for [biblioleaks](https://www.jmir.org/2014/4/e112/). Furthermore, given the vulnerability of  these archives, we ought to look for alternative approaches that do not rule out using their resources, but also do not _depend_ on them.

## Archival properties

So far, the emphasis of this README has been on _durability_; and the "accidents of the archive" have been instances of destruction and loss. The persistence of an archive is, however, no guarantee of its _accessibility_, a common reality in digital libraries where access management is ubiquitous. Official institutions police access to their archives vigilantly for the ostensible purpose of preservation, but ultimately creating a rarified relationship between the archives and their publics. Disregarding this precious tendency, we also introduce _adaptability_ as a fundamental consideration in the making of the projects, Dat Library and HyperReadings.

To adapt is to fit something for a new purpose. It emphasizes that the archive is not a dead object of research but a set of possible tools waiting to be activated in new circumstances. This is always a possibility of an archive, but we want to treat this possibility as desirable, as the horizon towards which these projects move. We know how infrastructures can attenuate desire and simply just make things difficult. We want to actively encourage radical reuse.

In the following section, we don't define these properties but rather discuss how we implement (or fail to implement) them in software, while highlighting some of the potential difficulties introduced.

### Durability (being reliable, redundant, etc.)
### Accessibility (ability to access)
### Adoptability (ability to use/ modify as oneâ€™s own)

## Use cases
### Thorunka
### Academia.edu alternative
### Syllabus
### Self-education

## Proposition
### Role of individuals
### Role of institutions
