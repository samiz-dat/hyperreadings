## Introduction

How might we ensure the survival and availability of community libraries, individual collections, and other precarious archives? If these libraries, archives, and collections are unwanted by official institutions or, worse, buried beneath good intentions and bureaucracy, then what tools and platforms and queer institutions might we develop instead?

While trying to both formulate and respond to these questions, we began making Dat Library (DatDatDat?!) and HyperReadings:

**Dat Library** distributes libraries across many computers so that many people can provide disk space and bandwidth, sharing in the labour and responsibility of the archival infrastructure.

**HyperReadings** implements "reading lists," or a structured set of pointers (a list, a syllabus, a bibliography, etc.) into one or more libraries, _activating_ the archives.

...

The 1996 UNESCO publication, "Lost Memory - Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the Twentieth Century," makes the fragility of historical repositories startlingly clear. "[A]cidified paper that crumbles to dust, leather, parchment, film and magnetic light attacked by light, heat humidity or dust" all assault archives. "Floods, fires, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes" and, of course, "acts of war, bombardment and fire, whether deliberate or accidental" wiped out significant portions of many hundreds of major research libraries worldwide. When expanding the scope to consider public, private, and community libraries, that number becomes uncountable.

Published during the early days of the World Wide Web, the report acknowledges the emerging role of digitization ("online databases, CD-ROM etc."), but today we might reflect on the last 20 years...

Digital archives and libraries are subject to a number of potential hazards: technical accidents like disk failures, accidental deletions, misplaced data, imperfect migrations; and political-economic accidents like defunding of the hosting insitution, deaccessioning parts of the collection, and sudden restriction of access rights.



Traditionally, archives and libraries have been situated in a particular place. The collection of books that makes up a library, for example, is  housed in the building also called a library. This is advantageous for two reasons: through organization, individual items are reasonably easy to find; and the overall contents can be protected and preserved.
